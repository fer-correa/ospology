# Author's Guide

Guidance on how to write content for the OSPO Book and prepare it for submission.

## Follow the chapter structure

## Use the writing style guide

## Use markdown

Markdown helps you to write content in a formatted way while making it easier to create lists, headings, etc, without learning complex syntax.  Book content must be in Markdown format at the point you add it to the `todogroup/ospology` repository on GitHub. For more information about Markdown, see:
* [A beginner's guide for using basic markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics).
* [Markdown Syntax reference](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).

## Run pre-commit checks locally

* Build the site locally to check if it looks right. 
* Run `Vale` checks locally using the `pre-commit` tool.
